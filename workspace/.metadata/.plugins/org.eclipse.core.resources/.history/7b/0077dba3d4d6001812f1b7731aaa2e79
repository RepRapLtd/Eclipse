/**
 * This program reads a list of triangles from an STL file, which have no imposed structure.
 * 
 * It attempts to stitch them together to form meshes of triangles where each triangle has
 * three corners in space and opposite them three sides.  Each side connects to another triangle 
 * in the mesh.  The result is then written to a new file with all that structure intact.
 * 
 * A certain amount of checking for integrity and solidity is done.
