This repository is the complete Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/) development
environment for several RepRap Ltd software projects:

opencv-one:

(Wierd name for) a project to develop a painting robot.  Not housepainting, 
Peter Paul Rubens painting.


triangulator:

A suite of software for working with STL 3D printing triangulation files.  One
aim is an interactive program that allows you to paint stresses onto the 
surface that then finite-element-optimises the shape.
