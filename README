This repository is the complete Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/) development
environment for several RepRap Ltd software projects:

CPPPaintRobot:

A C++ project to develop a painting robot.  Not housepainting, 
Peter Paul Rubens painting.


JavaPaintRobot:

Initial Java experiments for the above project. Frozen and abandoned.


Polyhedra:

A suite of Java software for working with STL 3D printing triangulation files.  One
aim is an interactive program that allows you to paint stresses onto the 
surface that then finite-element-optimises the shape.  Another is to use Woo's Alternating
Sum of Volumes algorithm to make a robust CSG representation of an STL file object as an
intersection and union of infinite planar half-spaces.


Electric3DPrinter:

Simulation of the new type of 3D printer with no moving parts proposed here:

This also needs our version of Dominik Wodniok's marching cubes program in

https://github.com/RepRapLtd/dualmc

to create 3D STL files from its output tensor files.  These can then be viewed in, for example, FreeCAD (https://www.freecadweb.org/).  It also uses gnuplot (http://www.gnuplot.info) for debugging.
